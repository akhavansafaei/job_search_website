This is a graduate sales role with a manufacturer of 'green' construction products that requires an exceptional graduate from a technical discipline (scientific or engineering led) that has progressed into a sales role, either business to business or proactive business to consumer sales, i.e. where you proactively approach and engage customers to purchase for instance door to door sales, furniture retail, utility sales, etc. This is a new business oriented sales role which involves strategic cold calling so is not for 'shrinking violets' or anyone that would be fazed by sales rejection. The absolute ideal candidate will have a construction related degree (Civil Engineering, Construction Management, Construction Management, Construction Project Management, Building Sciences, Environmental Engineering, Structural Engineering, Geophysics, Geomechanics, Construction Science, Construction Economics, etc) and progressed to have experience of making Business to Business Cold Calls.

To demonstrate the qualities required your CV should demonstrate indications of being above the 'norm'  perhaps you have played sport at a high level or represented your university in debating competitions, had involvement in the Student Union, led charity fundraising campaigns or something similarly 'outstanding' like working for charities on a volunteer basis, climbing mountains, undertaking the Duke of Edinburgh or similar awards, etc. As you can probably tell we are looking for an achiever with a 'zest for life' and a key part of the interview process will be based around your attitude, aspirations and determination to get ahead. The role requires a selfmotivated individual that is a 'sponge' for information and has a desire to learn and grow. As such the role requires good alphanumeric skills, IT competency, the ability to 'think outside the box' and above all dedication, hard work and selfdiscipline. The role requires an individual with brilliant communication skills together with high levels of drive and intelligence together with a reasonable understanding of maths and design. As a person you will be articulate, highly personable, well presented, self motivated and a good listener. To apply you will also be a driver.

240.0,Sales,Sales Development Manager,68806418,Selection Group Ltd,"Sales Development Manager  Circa ****k plus excellent bonus, car allowance, pension etc. This is a home based role based anywhere in England. Working for a fast growing manufacturer of high quality printed packaging predominately into the food and beverage markets. This role is to assume responsibility for an exciting new area of the business focusing on the alcohol, spirits and whisky sectors. The Company This manufacturer of printed packaging is a fairly new player within what is an established market and in just under 15 years it has grown to in excess of 40million per annum. The company boasts state of the art facilities that are a result of constant investment based on both the market and its client s needs. There is another 5million of planned investment over the next 12 months that has led to the creation of this new position within the business. The company predominantly sells into the food beverage sector with a focus on RRP for the wine, spirits and food sectors (poultry, snacks, fresh produce) but is also making inroads into other world class markets. With a highly skilled and loyal workforce, everyone feels a part of the business and the company is what I would define as an extremely modern plant. In order to continue the growth of the business, the company is now looking for a Sales Manager to develop the spirit and whisky markets. The Role Reporting to the Sales Director, your role will initially be to develop sales focusing on the Whisky and Spirit markets. Due to the new investment into a superb new multimillion machine, you will take this new, high quality product offering to both existing accounts within the business and into these new markets. To start with, you will strategically target certain companies, many of which already are aware and have high opinions and a very credible view of this business, with the aim of developing new business and introducing the new product line. All business wins will become key accounts that you will then manage. Due to the fact you will become the pioneer within the business for this product, success and dedication could potentially open up management opportunities. This is an excellent role within an ambitious and extremely successful business. The Applicant The ideal candidate will have a background of developing new business and managing accounts within the food or beverage packaging sectors. Knowledge of the Whisky/Spirits sector would be a huge advantage but not a prerequisite. However, the company is looking for someone who has sold a form of printed packaging (flexible, carton board, labels etc.) into the above sectors. As well being a commercially strong Sales person, a background in production or design would aid what is a technical and design led sell. A combination of both commercial and design/technical would be of great interest. An understanding of print is important. If you are passionate, focused and ambitious then this role could open up excellent opportunities in the future.
